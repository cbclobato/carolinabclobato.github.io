Delivery systems

Practical applications for the application of microbial organisms in plant production are lacking. This project aims to fill this gap by identifying key endophytes in various *Cannabis* cultivars and investigating the use of a fully biodegradable hydrous polymer to deliver these beneficial microbes into cultivation systems. The ultimate goal is to create an innovative, bio-based product that improves microbial diversity in *Cannabis* farming, showcasing broader agricultural benefits in the process. The use of *Cannabis* seed endophytes presents an exciting new biotechnological solution to meet the growing global demand for *Cannabis* products, offering a sustainable approach to cultivation that could transform the industry.
