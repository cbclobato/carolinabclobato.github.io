Domestication and intensive breeding have shaped modern crops, enhancing yield and specific traits like disease resistance and chemical composition. However, this process has also consequences for plant-microbe interactions. In our recent study, conducted at Graz University of Technology, We investigated how domestication has shaped the seed microbiome of *Cannabis*. We found that intensive breeding has led to a loss of seed microbial diversity and, with it, potentially valuable bacterial species. Notably, we were able to recover a beneficial bacterium from low-domestication *Cannabis* genotypes and demonstrate its potential to enhance plant growth — highlighting the importance of microbiome-based strategies for sustainable agriculture.

**The Seed Microbiome: An Overlooked Factor in Plant Health**
<br>
While the importance of root and soil microbiomes is well established, far less attention has been given to how plant breeding has influenced the microbial composition of seeds. Seeds are not just genetic repositories; they also harbor complex microbial communities that influence plant development by enhancing nutrient uptake, stimulate plant growth, and provide protection against pathogens. Among these, seed endophytes — microorganisms that reside within seeds—can be passed down across plant generations, shaping the initial microbial landscape of emerging plants. By carrying both genetic and microbial legacies, seeds provide a crucial foundation for plant establishment and microbial colonization.

In our research, we analyzed the bacterial communities of 46 *Cannabis* genotypes, covering a range from traditional landraces to modern cultivated varieties. The results revealed a clear pattern: as breeding intensity increased, microbial diversity declined. Landrace varieties harbored a more diverse microbiome, while inbred lines exhibited a homogenized composition dominated by fewer bacterial taxa. These findings suggest that breeding may have inadvertently led to the loss of microbes that once played a crucial role in plant health and stress resilience.

**Reintroducing a Lost Beneficial Bacterium**
<br>
One of the most striking discoveries in our study was the identification of *Bacillus frigoritolerans* C1141, a bacterial species strongly associated with low-domestication *Cannabis* genotypes but largely absent from modern cultivated varieties. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that this bacterium possesses genes linked to plant growth promotion, including phytohormone production, nutrient solubilization, and stress resistance.

To test its potential, we reintroduced *B. frigoritolerans* C1141 to *Cannabis* plants in both controlled and field experiments. The results were remarkable: treated plants grew 43% taller, nearly doubled their stalk diameter, and produced three times the biomass compared to untreated plants. These effects surpassed those of *Serratia plymuthica*, a well-established plant-beneficial bacterium, demonstrating the power of rediscovering and harnessing lost microbial diversity.

**Implications for Sustainable Agriculture**
<br>
Our findings underscore the critical role of seed microbiomes in plant fitness and highlight the need for breeding programs to consider microbial conservation. Instead of relying solely on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, integrating beneficial microbes into agricultural systems could enhance plant resilience while reducing chemical inputs.

Although this study focused on *Cannabis*, similar microbial shifts have been observed in other domesticated crops, suggesting broader implications for global agriculture. Future research should explore how microbiome restoration strategies can be applied across different plant species to promote sustainable and resilient farming.

By recognizing seeds as both genetic and microbial reservoirs, we can rethink breeding strategies and harness the full potential of plant-microbe interactions. This approach offers a promising path toward ecologically sound and productive agricultural systems — one where beneficial microbes play as important a role as the plants themselves.

<!-- Rediscovering Nature — How Cannabis Seeds Can Hold the Key to Sustainable Agriculture - the first version

Modern agriculture has transformed how we cultivate plants, but it has also come at a cost: soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, and reduced microbial diversity in plants. Our new study at Graz University of Technology reveals how the process of plant domestication has altered the microbial communities inside *Cannabis* seeds — sometimes for the worse. The good news? A beneficial bacterium lost during domestication has been recovered and could help boost plant growth and resilience.

**The Hidden World Inside a Seed**
<br>
While we often think of seeds as tiny capsules carrying the next generation of plants, they are much more than that. Seeds also house a vast community of microorganisms, known as the microbiome, which plays a crucial role in plant health. These microbes can help plants absorb nutrients, resist diseases, and even tolerate harsh environmental conditions. However, selective breeding and intensive farming may have disrupted this delicate microbial balance.

In our study, we analyzed the bacterial communities of *Cannabis* seeds from 46 different plant genotypes, spanning from landraces to modern varieties. We found that as *Cannabis* was selectively bred for specific traits—such as fiber production or high cannabinoid content—the diversity of its seed microbiome decreased. In particular, heavily domesticated plants had a more uniform microbial composition, missing many of the beneficial bacteria found in their wild ancestors.

**A Bacterium with Superpowers**
<br>
Among the microbial species lost in domesticated *Cannabis* was a particularly promising one: *Bacillus frigoritolerans* C1141. This bacterium, originally found in low-domestication *Cannabis* seeds, possesses genes that enable it to promote plant growth, improve stress tolerance, and enhance nutrient uptake. We tested its potential by reintroducing it to *Cannabis* plants and observed remarkable results.

Under field conditions, plants treated with *B. frigoritolerans* grew significantly taller, developed thicker stalks, and produced three times more biomass than untreated plants. This bacterium appears to act as a natural plant booster, making *Cannabis* more robust without the need for synthetic fertilizers or pesticides.

**What This Means for Agriculture**
<br>
The findings highlight the untapped potential of seed microbiomes in agriculture. By preserving and restoring beneficial microbes lost during domestication, we could develop more resilient crops that require fewer chemical inputs. This approach aligns with the growing movement toward sustainable farming practices that work in harmony with nature rather than against it.

While this study focused on *Cannabis*, the implications extend to many other crops. If scientists can identify and harness beneficial seed microbes in wheat, corn, and rice, for example, we could enhance global food security while reducing agriculture’s environmental footprint.

**The next step?**
<br>
Further research into how these bacteria function and interact with plants, and how they can be integrated into agricultural systems. In the future, farmers may be able to "rewild" their crops—not by abandoning agriculture, but by reintroducing the microscopic allies that plants evolved with over millennia.

This study serves as a reminder that sometimes, nature already has the best solutions—we just need to look a little closer.

Rediscovering the Microbial Legacy of Seeds: How Cannabis Domestication Altered Its Microbiome - Another version

Seeds carry more than just genetic material; they are living reservoirs of microbial communities passed from one plant generation to the next. This process, known as microbial inheritance, plays a fundamental role in plant health and adaptation. However, modern breeding practices have largely overlooked this hidden legacy, often disrupting long-standing plant-microbe relationships in pursuit of specific agronomic traits.

In our research, we investigated how domestication has shaped the seed microbiome of *Cannabis*. By analyzing 46 *Cannabis* genotypes, ranging from traditional landraces to intensively bred varieties, I found that breeding has led to a significant reduction in microbial diversity. As selection pressures focused on plant traits such as cannabinoid content and fiber quality, the complexity of the seed microbiome diminished, potentially stripping plants of beneficial microbial partners accumulated over thousands of years.

The loss of these microbial allies raises important questions about how breeding decisions have influenced plant resilience. Among the missing microbes, We identified *Bacillus frigoritolerans* C1141, a bacterium highly associated to low-domestication *Cannabis* genotypes and nearly absent in modern cultivated varieties. This bacterium possesses a suite of plant-beneficial traits, including the ability to solubilize nutrients, enhance stress tolerance, and promote growth through phytohormone production.

When seeds germinate, the surviving microbes establish a foundation for the plant’s microbiome, influencing root development, disease resistance, and nutrient uptake. In highly domesticated *Cannabis* varieties, this process appears to be increasingly dominated by a narrower set of microbial species, potentially limiting the plant’s ability to respond to environmental challenges.

To test whether lost microbial diversity could be restored, we reintroduced *B. frigoritolerans* C1141 to *Cannabis* plants under both controlled and field conditions. The results were striking: treated plants grew 43% taller, developed nearly double the stalk diameter, and produced three times the biomass compared to untreated controls. These findings suggest that reintroducing beneficial microbes lost during domestication could serve as a powerful tool for improving crop performance without relying on synthetic inputs.

This study highlights the need for a microbiome-aware approach to plant breeding. By integrating microbial conservation into agricultural strategies, we could develop crops that naturally resist pathogens, adapt to stress, and optimize nutrient uptake. Rather than viewing plants as standalone organisms, we must recognize them as holobionts—intimately connected with their microbial symbionts.

As we refine our understanding of microbial inheritance, we open new possibilities for transforming agriculture. Moving beyond a reliance on chemical interventions, we can leverage the power of plant-associated microbes to create more resilient and sustainable cropping systems. In the case of *Cannabis*—and potentially many other crops—the key to future agricultural success may lie not just in the genes of the plant, but in the invisible microbial partners it carries within its seeds.-->
