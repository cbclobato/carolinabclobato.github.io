Modern agriculture has transformed how we cultivate plants, but it has also come at a cost: soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, and reduced microbial diversity in plants. Our new study at Graz University of Technology reveals how the process of plant domestication has altered the microbial communities inside *Cannabis* seeds — sometimes for the worse. The good news? A beneficial bacterium lost during domestication has been recovered and could help boost plant growth and resilience.

**The Hidden World Inside a Seed**
<br>
While we often think of seeds as tiny capsules carrying the next generation of plants, they are much more than that. Seeds also house a vast community of microorganisms, known as the microbiome, which plays a crucial role in plant health. These microbes can help plants absorb nutrients, resist diseases, and even tolerate harsh environmental conditions. However, selective breeding and intensive farming may have disrupted this delicate microbial balance.

In our study, we analyzed the bacterial communities of *Cannabis* seeds from 46 different plant genotypes, spanning from landraces to modern varieties. We found that as *Cannabis* was selectively bred for specific traits—such as fiber production or high cannabinoid content—the diversity of its seed microbiome decreased. In particular, heavily domesticated plants had a more uniform microbial composition, missing many of the beneficial bacteria found in their wild ancestors.

**A Bacterium with Superpowers**
<br>
Among the microbial species lost in domesticated *Cannabis* was a particularly promising one: *Bacillus frigoritolerans* C1141. This bacterium, originally found in low-domestication *Cannabis* seeds, possesses genes that enable it to promote plant growth, improve stress tolerance, and enhance nutrient uptake. We tested its potential by reintroducing it to *Cannabis* plants and observed remarkable results.

Under field conditions, plants treated with *B. frigoritolerans* grew significantly taller, developed thicker stalks, and produced three times more biomass than untreated plants. This bacterium appears to act as a natural plant booster, making *Cannabis* more robust without the need for synthetic fertilizers or pesticides.

**What This Means for Agriculture**
<br>
The findings highlight the untapped potential of seed microbiomes in agriculture. By preserving and restoring beneficial microbes lost during domestication, we could develop more resilient crops that require fewer chemical inputs. This approach aligns with the growing movement toward sustainable farming practices that work in harmony with nature rather than against it.

While this study focused on *Cannabis*, the implications extend to many other crops. If scientists can identify and harness beneficial seed microbes in wheat, corn, and rice, for example, we could enhance global food security while reducing agriculture’s environmental footprint.

**The next step?**
<br>
Further research into how these bacteria function and interact with plants, and how they can be integrated into agricultural systems. In the future, farmers may be able to "rewild" their crops—not by abandoning agriculture, but by reintroducing the microscopic allies that plants evolved with over millennia.

This study serves as a reminder that sometimes, nature already has the best solutions—we just need to look a little closer.
