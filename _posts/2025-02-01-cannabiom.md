*Cannabis* has quickly emerged as a prominent player in both the food and nutraceutical markets, particularly in Europe and the USA. As its popularity continues to grow, farmers face new challenges in producing high-quality *Cannabis* due to the need for innovative cultivation techniques. Modern *Cannabis* varieties, the result of decades of intensive breeding, are increasingly susceptible to both biotic and abiotic stresses, in part due to a reduction in genetic and microbial diversity. However, recent studies suggest that microorganisms naturally found in plant seeds, specifically *Cannabis*, could offer a promising alternative to chemical fertilizers. These beneficial microbes not only enhance agricultural productivity but also support healthier plants and soils.

Despite their potential, *Cannabis* seed endophytes—microorganisms that live within the plant tissues—have been little explored, and no practical applications have been developed for their use in *Cannabis* production. This project aims to fill this gap by identifying key endophytes in various *Cannabis* cultivars and investigating the use of a fully biodegradable hydrous polymer to deliver these beneficial microbes into cultivation systems. The ultimate goal is to create an innovative, bio-based product that improves microbial diversity in *Cannabis* farming, showcasing broader agricultural benefits in the process. The use of *Cannabis* seed endophytes presents an exciting new biotechnological solution to meet the growing global demand for *Cannabis* products, offering a sustainable approach to cultivation that could transform the industry.
